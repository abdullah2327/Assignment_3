                <h1>Sri Lanka Tea Plantation</h1>
        <p>
            Not long after the British occupied the Teardrop Isle in the early 19th century, they realised Sri Lanka's highlands were ideal for growing tea. Plantations were terraced into the mountainsides, factories and rudimentary accommodations built for pickers, and a rail network engineered to transport leaves down to Colombo. The stretch of line between Kandy and Ella is considered one of the most beautiful in the world <br>

            Tea remains a significant part of the Sri Lanka's economy - they call it "green gold". And over the last decade, it's become a significant feature on holiday itineraries. The most popular plantations to visit are those around Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Ella, where a cool, misty climate makes for excellent growing conditions. <br>

            Sri Lanka is one of only a few countries where tea is still plucked by hand, from bushes planted along the contours of the slopes. A highly skilled workforce, predominantly Tamil women, moves along rows of bushes, stripping two leaves and a bud from each plant and often covering over 10km in a day. After picking, the leaves are immediately carried to the nearby factories where they are dried, processed and packed into crates ready for transportation.

        <h2>Nuwara Eliya Tea Plantation</h2>
        <p>
            Nuwara Eliya is the best known tea-growing district of Sri Lanka with her impressive lush green tea plantations. When you visit Sri Lanka, you can't miss exploring its incredible tea plantations and learn about tea production.  <br><br>
            Nuwara Eliya has quite a large number of tea factories, tea houses and tea fields. One of the most famous is Blue Field Tea Estate which is 20 kilometres north of Nuwara Eliya. They control a large estate around the factory and produce high quality tea that is being exported all over the world. Like many other popular tea factories in Sri Lanka, Bluefield Tea Factory offers a guided tour through the factory for its visitors. During the tour you will see how tea is dried, pressed and produced. You will get to see the various equipment and a guide will explain how they function.

    <section class="E-plan">
        <h2>Ella Tea Plantation</h2>
        <p>
            Ella has lately become a favourite destination for nature-loving travellers visiting Sri Lanka. The little hillside town offers plenty of hiking trails crossing through lush greenery and misty pine forests.
            <br><br>
            In my opinion, the tea plantations that you find in Ella are not as beautiful as the tea plantations in Nuwara Eliya. However, you may take a day tour to Dambathenna tea factory, where the tea plantations are stunningly beautiful.
            <br><br>
            If you're tight for time and would still like to experience a tea tour while in Ella itself, the Kinellan Tea Factory, Newburgh Green Tea Factory, Uva Halpewatte Tea Factory offer excellent tea factory tours.

            The hill capital of Kandy that is well known for the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a popular destination among travellers to Sri Lanka. Kandy is another location for mid-grown tea with its bright and robust infusions.
